In conclusion, our study rejects the null hypothesis. Our findings indicate a slight increase in layoffs associated with company funding and the relationship was determined to be statistically significant given the dataset used. Adding industry and growth stage into the model improved the modelâ€™s R-squared value, suggesting that these variables play a meaningful role, alongside funding, in influencing layoff numbers.

For future model improvements and research, we could include additional variables, such as company size or geographic location, which could yield additional insights while building upon existing studies exploring drivers of workforce reductions. We hope to provide organizations with data-driven insights for better workforce management during economic challenges.
